[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Commit451/BaselineGridTextView.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Commit451/BaselineGridTextView) [![](https://jitpack.io/v/Commit451/BaselineGridTextView.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Commit451/BaselineGridTextView)

# Usage
Usage is controlled through XML or programatically. Within XML:

```xml
<com.commit451.baselinegridtextview.BaselineGridTextView
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="wrap_content"
  android:text="hello world"
  app:lineHeightHint="24dp">
```
`lineHeightHint` is the desired line height, and should be a multiple of 4 to insure a 4dp rhythm. Alternately, you can use the attribute:
```xml
app:lineHeightMultiplierHint="1.2"
```
which will take your set text size and multiply it by the value specified.

or programatically:
```java
int size = getResources().getDimensionPixelSize(R.dimen.textsize);
textView.setLineHeightHint(size);
```

# Testing
We highly recommend the app [Keyline Pushing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.faizmalkani.keylines) for testing.
